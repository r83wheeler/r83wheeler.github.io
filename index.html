<h2>Week 1</h2>

<h4>Jan 25 - 29, 2021</h4>

<p>My first week in the remote portion of the bootcamp is more than what I thought it was going to be.
There is a lot of information and I have trouble keeping from diving too deep. I'm still working on finding
my routine and staying on top of the work load. My schedule was altered yesterday because I felt like I fell behind, so after my kids went to bed, I stayed up pretty late and worked on the excercises for Git. With my time, I try
and work for 50 minutes and break for 10. So far, I feel like those are my greatest struggles.</p>


<p>I'm eager to be able to put it all together and work seamlesly with all of these tools. Having the ability to
unleash my creativity and build something that is helpful for others is what I aim to do.</p>

<h2>Week 2</h2>

<h4>Feb 1 - 5, 2021</h4>

<p>During the second week of the bootcamp I found myself falling behind. This was mostly due to my misunderstanding (or non at all) of the GitHub workflow. The problem I have is not being able to visualize what is happening behind the scenes. A major problem I encountered was resolving merge conflicts. It took me a while to realize what my problem was, and I made more problems for myself during that time. So, GitHub seems to be a challenge for me, but I am persistant. I won't give up until I am fully proficient with it.</p>

<p>What are my thoughts on pseudocoding? I can see the real benefits of pseudocoding. It's good to have an outline of a project before moving forward to tackle it. I spent a lot of years in construction, and we always had blueprints, estimates, ghantt charts, etc. It would be foolish to try and build a skyscraper without direction.</p>

<p>I'm intrigued by the responsive web technologies we are learning about. I can't help but wonder how it was initially created. I'm also excited to get into pseudocoding because I think it will really help me become a skilled programmer.</p>

<h2>Week 3</h2>

<h4>Feb 8 - 12, 2021</h4>

<p>What are my thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and user experience? There is a lot to learn! I like that i'm able to reference external CSS and JavaScript files in my HTML. I think there are a lot of advantages to seperating HTML and code. For one, it makes HTML, CSS and JavaScript easier to read and maintain. </p>

<p>What are some objects that my blog incorporates? Well, in JavaScript, almost everything is an object. I just added a scroll to top button to my blog. The scrollFunction is an example of an object.</p>

<p>My thoughts on pseudo coding haven't changed. I still find it very usefull, although I am still struggling on the Codewars Katas. I'm still trying to grasp how all of the methods work within functions. I find myself going from one rabbit hole to another, but not really getting ahead. I'm confident that in time, I will figure it out. </p>

<p><q>I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.</q></p>
