<h3>Week 1</h3>
<p>My first week in the remote portion of the bootcamp is more than what I thought it was going to be.
There is a lot of information and I have trouble keeping from diving too deep. I'm still working on finding
my routine and staying on top of the work load. My schedule was altered yesterday because I felt like I fell behind, so after my kids went to bed, I stayed up pretty late and worked on the excercises for Git. With my time, I try
and work for 50 minutes and break for 10. So far, I feel like those are my greatest struggles.</p>


<p>I'm eager to be able to put it all together and work seamlesly with all of these tools. Having the ability to
unleash my creativity and build something that is helpful for others is what I aim to do.</p>

<h3>Week 2</h3>


<p>During the second week of the bootcamp I found myself falling behind. This was mostly due to my misunderstanding (or non at all) of the GitHub workflow. The problem I have is not being able to visualize what is happening behind the scenes. A major problem I encountered was resolving merge conflicts. It took me a while to realize what my problem was, and I made more problems for myself during that time. So, GitHub seems to be a challenge for me, but I am persistant. I won't give up until I am fully proficient with it.</p>

<p>What are my thoughts on pseudocoding? I can see the real benefits of pseudocoding. It's good to have an outline of a project before moving forward to tackle it. I spent a lot of years in construction, and we always had blueprints, estimates etc. It would be foolish to try and build a skyscraper withough direction.</p>

<p>I'm intrigued by the responsive web technologies we are learning about. I can't help but wonder how it was initially created. I'm also excited to get into pseudocoding because I think it will really help me become a skilled programmer.</p>
