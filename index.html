<h2>Week 1</h2>

<h4>Jan 25 - 29, 2021</h4>

<p>My first week in the remote portion of the bootcamp is more than what I thought it was going to be.
There is a lot of information and I have trouble keeping from diving too deep. I'm still working on finding
my routine and staying on top of the work load. My schedule was altered yesterday because I felt like I fell behind, so after my kids went to bed, I stayed up pretty late and worked on the excercises for Git. With my time, I try
and work for 50 minutes and break for 10. So far, I feel like those are my greatest struggles.</p>


<p>I'm eager to be able to put it all together and work seamlesly with all of these tools. Having the ability to
unleash my creativity and build something that is helpful for others is what I aim to do.</p>

<h2>Week 2</h2>

<h4>Feb 1 - 5, 2021</h4>

<p>During the second week of the bootcamp I found myself falling behind. This was mostly due to my misunderstanding (or non at all) of the GitHub workflow. The problem I have is not being able to visualize what is happening behind the scenes. A major problem I encountered was resolving merge conflicts. It took me a while to realize what my problem was, and I made more problems for myself during that time. So, GitHub seems to be a challenge for me, but I am persistant. I won't give up until I am fully proficient with it.</p>

<p>What are my thoughts on pseudocoding? I can see the real benefits of pseudocoding. It's good to have an outline of a project before moving forward to tackle it. I spent a lot of years in construction, and we always had blueprints, estimates, ghantt charts, etc. It would be foolish to try and build a skyscraper without direction.</p>

<p>I'm intrigued by the responsive web technologies we are learning about. I can't help but wonder how it was initially created. I'm also excited to get into pseudocoding because I think it will really help me become a skilled programmer.</p>

<h2>Week 3</h2>

<h4>Feb 8 - 12, 2021</h4>

<p>What are my thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and user experience? There is a lot to learn! I like that i'm able to reference external CSS and JavaScript files in my HTML. I think there are a lot of advantages to seperating HTML and code. For one, it makes HTML, CSS and JavaScript easier to read and maintain. </p>

<p>What are some objects that my blog incorporates? Well, in JavaScript, almost everything is an object. I just added a scroll to top button to my blog. The scrollFunction is an example of an object.</p>

<p>My thoughts on pseudo coding haven't changed. I still find it very usefull, although I am still struggling on the Codewars Katas. I'm still trying to grasp how all of the methods work within functions. I find myself going from one rabbit hole to another, but not really getting ahead. I'm confident that in time, I will figure it out. </p>

<h2>Week 4</h2>

<h4>Feb 15 - 19, 2021</h4>

<p>What was one thing that I liked and disliked about each of the new topics covered in prework?</p>

<p>Git and GitHub - What I like about Git and GitHub is that I'm able to save versions of my projects and know that whenever I come back to them, they will be there, unaltered. I had a lot of trouble using git and github initially. One small misstep left me lost and I ended up creating a lot more problems for myself while trying to fix the original problem.</p>

<p>Chrome Dev Tools - There isn't anything that I particularly disliked about Chrome Dev Tools. What I do like is the ability to test JavaScript code in the console. It's been very helpful for me to tryout for loops, for-in loops, for-of loops, while, and do-while loops. The more I can practise these, the better I will become as a programmer.</p>

<p>Visual Studio Code - There isn't anyting that I don't like about VS Code. As a matter of fact, it's my preferred text editor. One feature I really enjoy is the color coded text that is used to differentiate the syntax. The formatting also makes the code a lot easier to follow.</p>

<p>HTML - Again, nothing here to dislike. One thing I really like, is the ability to us hyperlinks. Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other documents or resources, link to specific parts of documents, or make apps available at a web address.</p>

<p>CSS - One important thing I learned about CSS is type selectors. These select an HTML tag/element and add a CSS rule to them. I find it to be pretty amazing that I can us a span element, wrap it around some text, then assign that element to place a yellow background color to be applied to it. There are so many options that really piques my curiousity about CSS.</p>

<p>Pseudo Code - We learned about Pseudo Code, which I can see is going to be very important. Asking the questions, what, how, why, when and sometimes who, will help us as programmers to understand the problem at hand and bring us to a solution.</p>

<p>I'd say for me personally, what hindered my progress these last four weeks is being in a remote working environment. I find it to be easier to learn if i'm there in person around my peers and instructors. Sometimes it can be hard for me to articulate the problem i'm experiencing. Having the ability to share my screen on zoom has diminished this issue, but there still are a lot of pros to in person learning that I don't get in a remote environment.</p>

<p>I think my persistance really helped me overcome challenges. Searching through heaps of information until I found the solution can take a lot of persistance. Especially, if you're not exactly sure where to begin looking. Which is where I found myself most of the time. I think taking good notes, and really trying to understand what is being asked of me really helps to overcome challenges.</p>
